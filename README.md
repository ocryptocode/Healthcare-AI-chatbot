## Healthcare-AI-chatbot

The healthcare AI chatbot is a project of absolute perfection , being in the same ecosystem as https://github.com/educate.

The field of medicals and healthcare is a field that uses a lot of data, so the use of algorithms and AI is pretty simple and logical.

This project is a bot that has multiple functionalities and a concise algorithm.

This project is a simple healthcare chatbot built using Python. The chatbot uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand user queries, identify intents, extract relevant entities, and generate appropriate responses.
It aims to build an interactive chatbot that can assist users with healthcare-related inquiries.
